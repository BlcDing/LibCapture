# LibCapture

Implement of "A Third-party Library Traffic Identification Framework Using Federated Learning"

 We propose a new framework, named LibCapture, to identify TPL traffic. First, we leverage dynamic hooking and TPL detection technique to generate TPL traffic datasets. Then, based on the dataset, we propose a CNN-based federated learning (FL) model to identify TPL traffic. We apply our framework to 2327 real-world apps, and the results show that our proposed framework can achieve high TPL traffic identify accuracy.
